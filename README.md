Is common to provide special behavior of your app is running on the Simulator, on Objective-C this was pretty simple, this is how you did it:

```objc
#if TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR
    // Simulator
#else
    // Device
#endif
```

In Swift there's nothing as beautiful as that, so after [looking into StackOverflow I found this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24869481/detect-if-app-is-being-built-for-device-or-simulator-in-swift):

```swift
#if (arch(i386) || arch(x86_64)) && os(iOS)
    ...
#endif
```

Which works, but I hate copy pasting the same code everywhere, also `arch(i386)`?! That doesn't say anything, code should be self-explanatory and easy to understand. That's why I made a simple micro-library that helps with this.
